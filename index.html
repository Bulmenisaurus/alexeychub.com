                Welcome to my site! If you're lucky, about now I'm planning what cool things to 
                put on my site! ;) Also, if you have any suggestions on how to imporve AlexeyChub.com, 
                just keep them to yourself for now. :D I need to learn how to use Javascript too,
                so for a good while this will just be something to look at.
