Create a page which displays a random block texture from Minecraft, and you have to guess what is its name


# Steps:

1. Collect a list of all the blocks in Minecraft
   1. Filter out non 16x16 textures
   2. Maybe make sure its a full block, so no anvils?
   3. wither have it in a json file or as a giant object

2. randomly choose some block
   
3. create the other multiple choice answers
   1. randomly choose another one
   2. find a block with the most similar texture
   3. and a block with the most similar name

4. create the UI
   1. maybe base it on some other popular quiz things, like quizlet/kahoot/jackbox
